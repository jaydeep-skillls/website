## 🔨 What I Built

This website! I set up an Astro project and deployed it to Netlify. It took a few hours to get the design right but I'm happy with how it turned out. The goal is to use this as a personal log of what I'm up to each week.

## 📖 What I Read

Started reading *Deep Work* by Cal Newport. The core idea is that focused, uninterrupted work is becoming both rarer and more valuable. Only a few chapters in but it's already making me think about how I structure my days.

## ✦ What I Did

Went on a longer walk than usual this weekend — about 10km through the park. Also cooked a new recipe: pasta with roasted tomatoes and burrata. Turned out great.
